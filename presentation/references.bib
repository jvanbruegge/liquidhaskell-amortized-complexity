abstract="HipSpec is a system for automatically deriving and proving properties about functional programs. It uses a novel approach, combining theory exploration, counterexample testing and inductive theorem proving. HipSpec automatically generates a set of equational theorems about the available recursive functions of a program. These equational properties make up an algebraic specification for the program and can in addition be used as a background theory for proving additional user-stated properties. Experimental results are encouraging: HipSpec compares favourably to other inductive theorem provers and theory exploration systems.",

To that end, we present a tool, named <tt>hs-to-coq</tt>, that translates total Haskell programs into Coq programs via a shallow embedding. We apply our tool in three case studies – a lawful <tt>Monad</tt> instance, “Hutton’s razor”, and an existing data structure library – and prove their correctness. These examples show that this approach is viable: both that <tt>hs-to-coq</tt> applies to existing Haskell code, and that the output it produces is amenable to verification. },

abstract="SMT-based program verifiers often suffer from the so-called butterfly effect, in which minor modifications to the program source cause significant instabilities in verification times, which in turn may lead to spurious verification failures and a degraded user experience. This paper identifies matching loops (ill-behaved quantifiers causing an SMT solver to repeatedly instantiate a small set of quantified formulas) as a significant contributor to these instabilities, and describes some techniques to detect and prevent them. At their core, the contributed techniques move the trigger selection logic away from the SMT solver and into the high-level verifier: this move allows authors of verifiers to annotate, rewrite, and analyze user-written quantifiers to improve the solver's performance, using information that is easily available at the source level but would be hard to extract from the heavily encoded terms that the solver works with. The paper demonstrates three core techniques (quantifier splitting, trigger sharing, and matching loop detection) by extending the Dafny verifier with its own trigger selection routine, and demonstrates significant predictability and performance gains on both Dafny's test suite and large verification efforts using Dafny.",

Lean is an ongoing and long-term effort, but it already provides many useful components, integrated development environments, and a rich API which can be used to embed it into other systems.

abstract = {We introduce Refinement Reflection, a new framework for building SMT-based deductive verifiers. The key idea is to reflect the code implementing a user-defined function into the function’s (output) refinement type. As a consequence, at uses of the function, the function definition is instantiated in the SMT logic in a precise fashion that permits decidable verification. Reflection allows the user to write equational proofs of programs just by writing other programs using pattern-matching and recursion to perform case-splitting and induction. Thus, via the propositions-as-types principle, we show that reflection permits the specification of arbitrary functional correctness properties. Finally, we introduce a proof-search algorithm called Proof by Logical Evaluation that uses techniques from model checking and abstract interpretation, to completely automate equational reasoning. We have implemented reflection in Liquid Haskell and used it to verify that the widely used instances of the Monoid, Applicative, Functor, and Monad typeclasses actually satisfy key algebraic laws required to make the clients safe, and have used reflection to build the first library that actually verifies assumptions about associativity and ordering that are crucial for safe deterministic parallelism.},

To date, however, such reasoning always took place externally to Haskell, either manually on paper, or mechanised in a theorem prover. This article shows how equational reasoning can be performed directly and seamlessly within Haskell itself, and be checked using Liquid Haskell. In particular, language learners --- to whom external theorem provers are out of reach --- can benefit from having their proofs mechanically checked. Concretely, we show how the equational proofs and derivations from Graham's textbook can be recast as proofs in Haskell (spoiler: they look essentially the same).},
